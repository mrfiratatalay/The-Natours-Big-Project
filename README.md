# 🌿 The Natours Project — Advanced Web Design with CSS and Sass

Welcome to **The Natours Project**, one of our most design-focused projects where we explored the full power of CSS and Sass to build a visually stunning and scalable landing page for a fictional nature tour company.

## 👥 Team & Collaboration

This project was developed by **Fırat Atalay** and **Ayşe Mandıralı** as part of our journey to master frontend design and styling.  
Throughout the project, we worked together to turn creative design concepts into functional, responsive, and optimized web layouts — applying best practices in modular CSS and teamwork.

## 🎯 Project Description

The project began with a strong foundation in **pure CSS**, where we focused on crafting impressive visual elements such as:

- Background image overlays  
- Animations and transitions  
- Flexbox and Grid layout systems  
- Custom buttons and responsive sections

As the codebase grew, we migrated the entire styling structure into **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)** to improve:

- Modularity  
- Maintainability  
- Readability  
- Reusability of styles

This transition allowed us to build a scalable styling architecture that is production-ready and easy to manage.

- Why and how to transition to Sass for larger-scale projects
- How to structure a Sass project with partials, variables, and mixins
- Collaborative design principles: consistency, naming conventions, reusable utilities
- Breaking large UI components into manageable and maintainable parts
